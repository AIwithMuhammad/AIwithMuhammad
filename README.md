# 👋 Hi, I’m Muhammad Raffay

🎯 **AI Learner | Public Journey | Future Builder**  

I’m documenting my path to mastering Artificial Intelligence — one day, one project, one commit at a time.  
This repo is my **profile README**, a hub where you can track what I’m working on and where I’m headed.  

---

## 🚀 Current Focus  
- Learning the fundamentals of **Machine Learning** (linear regression, decision trees, supervised/unsupervised learning)  
- Building small projects & experiments in Python  
- Sharing my daily learning logs on GitHub + X  

---

## 📖 My Learning Log  
📝 Check out my repo: [ai-learning-log](https://github.com/AIwithMuhammad/ai-learning-log)  
That’s where I push daily notes, Jupyter notebooks, and mini-projects — think of it as my XP grind log.  

---

## 🎮 The Fun Twist  
I treat learning AI like a game:  
- **XP = knowledge gained daily**  
- **Boss fights = tricky concepts & projects**  
- **Loot = working models & cool insights**  

Every repo here is part of my grind to level up.
